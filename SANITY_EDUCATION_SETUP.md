# Setting Up Education Resources in Sanity

This guide will help you upload your downloadable lesson plans to Sanity CMS so they appear on the Education page.

## Overview

The education page now dynamically fetches lesson plans from Sanity. You need to:
1. Create zip files containing all materials for each lesson plan
2. Upload them to Sanity with the correct settings
3. They'll automatically appear on the website

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Prepare Your Zip Files

For each of the 7 lesson plans, create a **single zip file** containing all the materials (PowerPoint, Word docs, worksheets, etc.):

**Lesson Plans to Create:**
- Iron Age Pottery
- Roman Mosaics
- Ancient Flour Making
- Change in the 20th Century
- Digital Time Capsule
- Archaeology Time Machine
- Careers in Archaeology

**Example:** For "Iron Age Pottery", create `iron-age-pottery.zip` containing:
- `iron-age-pottery.pptx`
- `iron-age-pottery-worksheet.docx`
- `teacher-guide.pdf`
- Any other relevant files

### 2. Access Sanity Studio

2. It displays the title, description, key stages, and subjects
3. A **"Download Resources"** button appears that downloads your zip file
4. Users click the button and get all the lesson materials instantly

## Optional: Adding "Other Resources"

For resources like "Sensory Stories" or "Digital Time Capsule Gallery":
1. Create a new Education Resource
2. Select **Category**: "Other Learning Resources" (other-resources)
