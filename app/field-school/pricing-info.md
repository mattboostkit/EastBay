## Field School Information

Field School training activities will include: Site introduction; site induction including health and safety; archaeological excavation and the use of tools; finds processing; the written site record; archaeological site drawing; site surveys, site photography, and Historic Building Recording.

Subject to weather conditions and availability, we will also be running sessions on environmental processing and analysis, and geophysics.

A two-week Field School placement is priced at £800 per person and will include all training and necessary equipment, plus accommodation in a 4-person shared apartment in Folkestone. Please contact us for more information. 

We are happy to make suitable recommendations to those wishing to find their own private accommodation in the Canterbury or Folkestone areas. To attend the Field School without accommodation, fees will be £650 per person.

No prior experience is required. CAT provides accredited professional training. Individual progress is logged using the BAJR skills passport, a document recognised by most professional and academic institutions in the UK.
